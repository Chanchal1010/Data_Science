>Data Wrangling and visualization
Data wrangling involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a usable format for analysis. This process includes handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and structuring data for further analysis. Effective data visualization is crucial for understanding trends, patterns, and outliers in the data. By using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, we can create insightful visual representations that facilitate better decision-making and communication of results.

>Clustering
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters). The algorithm assigns each data point to the cluster with the nearest mean, iteratively refining cluster centers (centroids) to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares. K-means is widely used for its simplicity and efficiency in identifying patterns and structures within data. Visualization techniques such as scatter plots with cluster coloring can help illustrate the clustering results and validate the model's performance.

>Linear Regression
Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. It aims to minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values. Linear regression is widely used for its simplicity and interpretability. Visualization techniques like scatter plots with regression lines help in understanding the fit and the relationship between variables.

>Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes (e.g., yes/no, true/false) based on one or more independent variables. It models the probability of a particular class by applying the logistic function to a linear combination of the input features. Logistic regression is useful for situations where the dependent variable is categorical. Techniques such as ROC curves and confusion matrices are often used to evaluate the performance of logistic regression models.

>Monte Carlo
Monte Carlo simulations are computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to estimate numerical results. They are used to model the probability of different outcomes in processes that are difficult to predict due to the intervention of random variables. Monte Carlo methods are widely used in fields such as finance, engineering, and scientific research to perform risk analysis, optimization, and numerical integration.

>Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression. SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes. For non-linear data, the kernel trick is used to transform data into a higher-dimensional space. SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is applied in text classification, image recognition, and more. Visualization of decision boundaries helps understand the model's performance.
